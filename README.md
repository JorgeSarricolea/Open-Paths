# Open-paths

The idea of this program is to allow you to quickly access your folders or files without wasting time in the file explorer.

I created a menu where you can add the options (paths) that you can access directly, you can add or remove as needed.

I declared variables for each of my paths, you can simply name them as you like and assign the path you prefer.

Once you have the program modified to your liking, create a shortcut and place it where you can execute it when you start your PC or whenever you want to use it.

I hope it is very useful. üëç
